### Hi there 👋

I am an ML engineer primarily focused on NLP but starting to branch off in new directions.  I'm currently trying to learn more about Jax/Flax because I think there is a lot of potential and the flexibility to move between TPU and GPU is really nice.

I have a few models on the Hugging Face Hub: https://huggingface.co/nbroad

Beginning in mid-2021, I have been getting more involved on Kaggle. Here is my profile and my rankings are below: https://www.kaggle.com/nbroad  

That's my dog Maya in my profile photo. 🐶 She is perfect ❤️
